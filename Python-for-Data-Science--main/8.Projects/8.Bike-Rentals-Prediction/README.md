# Bike-Rentals-Prediction
Bike Share is a network of shared bicycles available for short-term use. Many cities in the world provides bike-sharing program for the citizens and visitors where they can rent a bike by the hour or day, ride it in the city and return it later. It helps to reduce traffic congestion in the city and thus improving air quality.It is also useful for promoting local tourism and hence local economy.

Like many world cities, Washington DC too has such bike-sharing program for the citizens and has multiple stations for renting and return and detailed data is collected on to find out how many peple are using the program on timely basis.

In this project, we will use the data collected in Washington DC and try to reach the goal using Machine Learning algorithms.
