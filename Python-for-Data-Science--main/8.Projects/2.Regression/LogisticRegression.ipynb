    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "[Logisitic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) is a statistical model used to predict a binary dependent variable, not unlike a binary classifier. Logistic regression is similar to a [single layer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network#Single-layer_perceptron), which is the basis for feedforward [artifical neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical definition of logistic regression is presented below, as well as the basics of the [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) algorithm used for training. Snippets of the equivalent Python code using numpy is also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "A network of single layer perceptrons can be combined to build a [multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) for [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). More sophisticated structures, such [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs), [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNNs), or [autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) can also be assembled as a network of single layer perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a weight vector $W$, bias scalar $b$, and activation function $\\sigma$, activation $a$ describing forward propagation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = \\sigma (W^T x + b) = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m-1}, a_m) \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent Python code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`a = sigmoid(np.dot(W.T, x) + b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Other activation functions, such as a [rectified linear unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) (ReLU) or [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) can also be used in place of [sigmoid functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function). ReLU does not suffer from the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) as found in the traditional sigmoid function. For this reason, ReLU is preferred in hidden layers of deep neural networks. Softmax is often used at the output layer of a classification model."
