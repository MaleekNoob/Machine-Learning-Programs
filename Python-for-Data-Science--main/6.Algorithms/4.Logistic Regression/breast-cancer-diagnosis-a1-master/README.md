<b>What:</b> Assignment 1 ISYS 620 (Data Analytics with Artificial Intelligence)

<b>Goal:</b> predict whether or not a patient has a positive breast cancer diagnosis based on tumor characteristics

<b>About the <i>Assignment - Breast Cancer Diagnosis.ipynb</i> file:</b> I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), applied mean imputation for missing values, built a classification model (logistic regression), and interpreted the results using sklearn's classification report and confusion matrix.

<b>About the <i>multicollinearity.ipynb</i> file:</b> I used the same dataset, however, I computed the variance inflation factor (VIF) to locate and drop the highly correlated variables. I re-ran the logistic regression model then compared the performance of both logistic regression models.
