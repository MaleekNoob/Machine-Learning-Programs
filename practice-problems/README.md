<h1>Sorting and Searching Algorithms in Python</h1>
<p>This repository contains basic implementations of sorting and searching algorithms in Python. These algorithms can be used to sort and search various data structures such as lists, arrays, and more.</p>

<h3>Available Algorithms</h3>
<p>The following algorithms are currently available in this repository:</p>

<ul><b>Sorting Algorithms</b>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Insertion Sort</li>
<li>Selection Sort</li>
<li>Merge Sort</li>
<li>Quick Sort</li></ul>
<ul>Searching Algorithms
<li>Linear Search</li>
<li>Binary Search</li></ul>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>To use these algorithms, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file, with a main function that demonstrates how to use the algorithm.</p><br>
<br>
<p>To run the main function of an algorithm, simply navigate to the file in your terminal or IDE and run the file using the Python interpreter. For example:</p>
<br>
<p>python bubble_sort.py</p>
<br><p>This will run the main function of the bubble sort algorithm and demonstrate how to use it to sort a list of numbers.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions for additional algorithms, or if you find a bug in an existing implementation, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.</p>
